The more you move \n  your fingers, the less efficient your typing will be!\n</p>\n\n<h3>\n  Posture\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n  To type correctly with the lowest risk for injury,\n</p>\n\n<img src=\"dist/img/posture.jpg\" class=\"floated floated-right\" />\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Sit forward in your chair with feet placed flat on the ground.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Keep your back straight.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Make sure your arms and hands are parallel to the keyboard.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Keep your wrists straight, not bending up or down toward \n    the keyboard.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Fingers should be curled toward each key, not flat.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  Tips &amp; Tricks\n</h3>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <strong>DO NOT</strong> look at your fingers when typing. \n    This will slow you down in the long run even though it is \n    easier at first.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Begin each exercise by finding the home row and making sure \n    you know which keys are under which fingers. This will make \n    looking at your hands unnecessary!\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Start slow and focus on accuracy. Speed is easier to \n    gain than poor accuracy is to fix.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Be patient! Learning to type accurately and with speed \n    takes a long time and lots of practice.

After reading \n  this guide, start with <a href=\"./lesson-1\">Lesson #1</a> and \n  complete all 15 lessons in order.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Make sure that when you are doing the exercises, you can see \n  the exercise, the keyboard, and the statistics!\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"page-featureimage\">\n  <img src=\"dist/img/howtouse.jpg\" />\n</div>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <strong>The Exercise:</strong> The exercise is the top section\n    of text. This is the text that you type in each exercise. \n    When you open an exercise, the first letter should be black \n    and underlined. The timer and WPM counter will start when you \n    begin typing.\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Watch out for spaces. Any characters other than a space \n        for spaces count as normal errors.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>The Keyboard:</strong> The keyboard can help you \n    avoid looking at your hands. The current letter you need to \n    type will be in yellow. If you type a wrong letter, it will \n    show you what you typed in red. If nothing is showing and \n    the exercise is not over, you are probably on a space.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>The Statistics:</strong> The statistics are just under \n    the keyboard. <strong>Characters</strong> tells you how many \n    keystrokes you have typed so far, <strong>errors</strong> tracks \n    the number of incorrect keystrokes, <strong>WPM</strong> tells \n    you how many words per minute you are typing, and \n    <strong>time</strong> tracks how long the exercise has taken you.\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Aim to get fewer than five errors and more than 20 WPM for \n        each exercise. Expect that you will have to do each exercise \n        multiple times to reach this goal.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Restart Exercise:</strong> If you need to do the \n    exercise again, you can click the \"Restart Exercise\" button to \n    reload the page and its exercise. When you are ready to move on, \n    select the next lesson in the navigation menu.\n  </li>\n</ol>";

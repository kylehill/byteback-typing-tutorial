  Lesson #12: C and ,
</h2>

<img src="dist/img/lesson12keyboard.gif" class="floated floated-right" />

<p>
  This is an important lesson because C is a very common letter 
  and the comma (,) is your first punctuation mark. 
  <strong>The C and ,</strong> are typed by curling the 
  <strong>middle fingers</strong> down to the bottom row of keys.

<p>
  C is one of the hardest reaches to learn. Doing this will be 
  awkward at first, so make sure you are comfortable with C 
  and comma before you move on!
